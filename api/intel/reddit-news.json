            "Trade is mutually beneficial , it's not someone doing others a favor out the goodness of their heart.",
            "First, China believes the alliance with Russia is a national security issue, which trumps economics.\u00a0\n\nSecond,\u00a0China\u2019s trade with the EU (783B) and US (664.5B) combined is only 25% of its total trade (5,936.8B). It\u2019s a big world out there and China isn\u2019t hurting their relationships with the rest of the world by supporting Russia.\u00a0\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_China",
            "Because it cannot partner with the US now.\n\nMany factors (individual leaders, ideologies, history, human rights etc.) play roles in China's foreign policy (and its feuds with the Western world). But China being the second (biggest power) is the most important one.\n\nIt is natural for the US, the currently dominant power, to deter its potential challenger. And it is not unreasonable, China would do the same if it was in US' position. The fact that China is the second is enough for the current hegemony to assume China as an adversary. China's true intentions (very few know), leadership (whether Xi, Hu or Deng), human rights records etc. are less relevant (Be real, many US' allies and friends are doing no better than China in terms of these factors). \n\nSure, China can help to fight Russia. But what is the next after Russia's defeat ? The US (and the West) will be friendly with China again? Those national security concerns will disappear? Advanced chips will be available for China? No, China, as long as remaining the second, will still be deterred, with more resources freed from the European front. So why would China side with the West?",
            "Their ultimate goal is to become a great power, and there are a tech war and trade war going between them and the west. So it is less of a case of choosing to partner with Russia, but more of a case of figuring out that west has became their competitors and you don\u2019t partner with your competitors.",
            "Since 1989, anti-Western ideology has been promoted as insurance against the mainland population wanting Western-style political rights. Russia is very willing to support and offer anti-Western ideology. On the other hand Russia can only offer modest concrete economic or military benefits."

            "SS:  \n1) Russia is asking for United States to include Ukraine in comprehensive security talks. \n\n2) Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin representative, is stressing the value of broad discourse that covers the entirety of the conflict as well as wider global security concerns. \n\n3) Presently the Ukraine conversation must be led by Ukraine, however, Americans insist on this showing the underlying complexity in US-Russia relations.",
            "Right now, Russia has what it really wanted, most of the ethnic Russian parts of Ukraine.  While Ukraine might not be able to take much of that back, they can kill an awful lot of Russians with western weapons while trying.\n\nRussia has been signaling for a few months now that they are willing to talk, but the US rightly says it is Ukraine's decision and Ukraine isn't in the mood for that right now.",
            "That's a really good sign. Fighter jets are on the horizon and the aid package helped Ukraine to stabilize the frontlines... there's even rumors about a ukrainian summer offensive. Russia knows that the odds are shifting again, hence these hypocritical, cynical calls for peace talks\n\nNow is definitely not the time to make any concessions towards the invaders",
            "What do Russian leaders want? Security for themselves. But that\u2019s only available within Russia. \n\nOutside Russia, they want continued control over Belarus not a final humiliating defection of their last client state to Europe. But the West can\u2019t guarantee even that for sure.",
            "Turn it into an offramp for Russia to exit Ukraine."
