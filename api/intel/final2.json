Like a Pok\u00e9mon type game there\u2019s multiple routes to success.

In the US these are usually growing, smaller city governments or mid-sized counties with poor environmental records but swinging towards progress, often with some long-incumbent Republicans still in leadership but battling with upstart Democrats who are trying to fund changes.

        "speaker_summary": "China, despite being lifted out of poverty through trade with the West, now partners with Russia for several reasons. The alliance addresses national security concerns and counters Western competition, especially considering ongoing tech and trade wars. This partnership also aligns with China's anti-Western ideological stance promoted since 1989.",

            "Trade is mutually beneficial , it's not someone doing others a favor out the goodness of their heart.",
            "First, China believes the alliance with Russia is a national security issue, which trumps economics.\u00a0\n\nSecond,\u00a0China\u2019s trade with the EU (783B) and US (664.5B) combined is only 25% of its total trade (5,936.8B). It\u2019s a big world out there and China isn\u2019t hurting their relationships with the rest of the world by supporting Russia.\u00a0\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_China",
            "Because it cannot partner with the US now.\n\nMany factors (individual leaders, ideologies, history, human rights etc.) play roles in China's foreign policy (and its feuds with the Western world). But China being the second (biggest power) is the most important one.\n\nIt is natural for the US, the currently dominant power, to deter its potential challenger. And it is not unreasonable, China would do the same if it was in US' position. The fact that China is the second is enough for the current hegemony to assume China as an adversary. China's true intentions (very few know), leadership (whether Xi, Hu or Deng), human rights records etc. are less relevant (Be real, many US' allies and friends are doing no better than China in terms of these factors). \n\nSure, China can help to fight Russia. But what is the next after Russia's defeat ? The US (and the West) will be friendly with China again? Those national security concerns will disappear? Advanced chips will be available for China? No, China, as long as remaining the second, will still be deterred, with more resources freed from the European front. So why would China side with the West?",
            "Their ultimate goal is to become a great power, and there are a tech war and trade war going between them and the west. So it is less of a case of choosing to partner with Russia, but more of a case of figuring out that west has became their competitors and you don\u2019t partner with your competitors.",
            "Since 1989, anti-Western ideology has been promoted as insurance against the mainland population wanting Western-style political rights. Russia is very willing to support and offer anti-Western ideology. On the other hand Russia can only offer modest concrete economic or military benefits."
